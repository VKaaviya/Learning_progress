		***Linux***

1.Find your Linux distribution:

        cat /etc/os-release

 2.Find Linux kernel version:

        uname -r or uname -a

 3.Find number of Cores/Socket:

        lscpu (look for "Core(s) per socket" and "Socket(s)")

 4.Check RAM size:

        free -h

        cat /proc/meminfo (look for "MemTotal")

 5.Monitor currently running processes and their RAM/Core usage:

        top or htop (a more user-friendly version)

6.Sort running processes by their RAM/Core usage:

        In top, press 'M' to sort by memory (%MEM) or 'P' to sort by CPU usage (%CPU).

        From the command line: ps aux --sort=-%cpu or ps aux --sort=-%mem

7.Check if your laptop has any GPU:

        lspci | grep -i vga or lspci | grep -i nvidia (if you know it's an NVIDIA card). You may also need to install and run nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs or radeontop for AMD GPUs.

8.Find the number of disks in your machine and their usage:

        lsblk

        df -h

9.Find all the USB devices connected in your machine:

        lsusb

        lsblk can also show USB storage devices

10.Difference between sudo and super user

    -->su (Super User): The su command is used to switch the current user to another user, most commonly the root user. When you run su, you are prompted for the root user's password. If successful, you gain a new shell with full administrative privileges, and you remain the root user until you exit that shell. This can be less secure as you have complete root access and could potentially make mistakes that affect the entire system.

    -->sudo (Super User Do): The sudo command allows a permitted user to execute a single command as the root user or another specified user. It's more secure and flexible because:

        You are asked for your own password, not the root password.

        It provides a temporary elevation of privilege for a single command.

        System administrators can configure the /etc/sudoers file to give specific users or groups permission to run only certain commands as root, providing granular control and limiting potential damage.
